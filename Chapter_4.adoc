== Chapter 4. Java Building Blocks

Classes are the major constructs in Java. But you need to know smaller elements that help you out to program the behavior and the flow of the program.  You need to know how commented your program so other people can understand your intentions (programmers often work in teams and help each other). You need to know how to write code that will invoke one method or the other depending on certain conditions. So in this chapter I'll show you some Java elements that you have to know and apply in pretty much any project.

=== Program Comments

You can add any text comments to your program to explain what a particular line, method or a class is for. First of all, someone else may read your program so comments would help in understanding your intentions. Second, even the  author of the code can't remember every program he or she wrote. Besides, if a professional programmer decides to change the employer, if would be nice to leave well-commented code behind.

There are three different types of comments - single-line comments, block comments, and a javadoc comments. Here's what they are for:

* If your comment fits in one line, start it with two slashes: 
+
[source,java]
----
// This method calculates the distance between A and B.
----
* If you want to write multi-line comments, instead of starting each line with two slashes, just surround the entire  text with these symbols: `/*` and `*/`, for example:
+
[source, java]
----
/* Now we'll handle the current 
   position of the Fish. 
*/ 
----
* Java comes with a special program `javadoc` that can extract all comments from your programs into a separate help file that can be displayed by any Web browser. This file can be used as a _technical documentation_ for your programs. Such comments are enclosed in  symbols `/* *` and   `*/`. Note the two asterisks after the first slash. Only the most important comments like the description of a class or a method should be placed between these symbols.
+
[source, java]
----
/** This method calculates the discount that depends  
on the price paid. If the price is more than $100,
give the user 20% off, otherwise only 10%.
*/
----
The javadoc tool can process your code, extract all comments that start with `/**` and create program documentation that can be published online or kept locally on the company server. We are not going to use javadoc in this book, but if you're interested to learn more about this tool, read Oracle's tutorial http://goo.gl/Bwm6Cb[How to Write Doc Comments for the Javadoc Tool].

From now on, I’ll be adding comments to code samples to  give you a better idea how and where to use them.

=== Making Decisions 

We always make decisions in our life: _If she is going to tell me  this_ – _I’m going to answer  that, otherwise I’ll do something else_. You can write a Java program that will "make decisions" with the help of `if` and `switch` statements. You can also build more complex either-or conditions using logical operators.

==== The if Statement 

Java has an `if` statement that checks if a particular expression is `true` or `false`. 

Based on the result of evaluating this expression, your program execution forks, and only the relevant portion of the code will be invoked.

For example, if the expression _Do I want to go to grandma's?_ is `true`,  turn to the left, otherwise turn to the right.	

[[FIG4-1]]
.The fork
image::images/fig_4_01.png[]

Take a look at the following code sample.  If an expression inside the parentheses is `true`, JVM will execute the code between the first pair of curly braces, otherwise it goes to the code after the `else` statement. In other words, if the value of the variable  `totalSpent` is more than a hundred, give a 20% discount, otherwise take only 10% off.

[source, java]
----
// Assume that the method getTotalAmount()
// adds up the prices from your shopping cart

int totalSpent = getTotalAmount();
float discountedPrice;

if (totalSpent > 100){
  discountedPrice=totalSpent*0.8;
  System.out.println("You’ll get a 20% discount”);
}
else{
  discountedPrice=totalSpent*0.9;
  System.out.println("You’ll get a 10% discount”);
}

System.out.println("Your discounted price is ” + discountedPrice);
----

Let’s modify the method `dive()` in the class `Fish` from Chapter 3 to make sure that our fish is not allowed to dive below 100 feet:

[source, java]
----
public class Fish extends Pet {

  int currentDepth=0;

  public int dive(int howDeep){
    currentDepth=currentDepth + howDeep;
      if (currentDepth > 100){
          System.out.println("I am a little fish and " 
                      + " can't dive below 100 feet");
          currentDepth=currentDepth - howDeep;
      }else{
        System.out.println("Diving for " + howDeep + 
                                             " feet");
        System.out.println("I'm at " + currentDepth +
                        " feet below the sea level");
      }
      return currentDepth; 
	}

	public String talk(String something){
       return "Don't you know that fish do not talk?";
	} 
}
----

Now just make a small change in the class `FishMaster` – let it  try  to make  our fish go deep under the sea:

[source, java]
----
public class FishMaster {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
		
    Fish myFish = new Fish();
 
  // Try to have the fish go below 100 feet	
	
  myFish.dive(2);  // go 2 feet down
	myFish.dive(97); // go another 97 feet down
	myFish.dive(3);  // go 3 more feet down
		
	myFish.sleep();
  }
}
----

Run this program and it’ll print the following on the system console:

'Diving for 2 feet.'
'I'm at 2 feet below the sea level.'
'Diving for 97 feet.'
'I'm at 99 feet below the sea level.'
'I am a little fish and can't dive below 100 feet.'
'Good night, see you tomorrow.'

==== Logical Operators

Sometimes, to make a decision you may need to check more than just one conditional expression, for example if the name of the state is Texas or California, add the state sales tax to the price of every item in the store. This is an example of the _logical or_ case – either Texas or California. 

In Java the sign for a logical `or` is one or two vertical bars. It works like this – if any of the two conditions is `true`, the result of the entire expression is also `true`. 

In the following examples I use a variable of type `String`, which has a method `equals()` that compares the values of two strings. I use it to see the value of the variable `state` is _"Texas"_ or  _"California"_: 

`if (state.equals("Texas") | state.equals("California"))`

You can also rewrite this `if` statement using two vertical bars: 

`if (state.equals("Texas") || state.equals("California"))`

The difference between these two examples is that if you use two bars, and the first expression is `true`, the second expression won’t  even be  checked.  If you place just a single bar, JVM will evaluate both expressions anyway.

The _logical and_ is represented by one or two ampersands (`&&`) and each expression in the parentheses must be `true` to make the entire expression `true`. For example, charge the sales tax only if the state is New York and the price is more than $110. Both conditions must be `true` _at the same time_:

`if (state.equals("New York") && price >110)`

or 

`if (state.equals("New York") & price >110)`

If you use double ampersand and the first expression is `false`, the second one won’t even be checked, because the entire expression will be `false` anyway.  With the single ampersand both expressions will be evaluated.

The _logical not_ is also known as `negation` and is  represented by the exclamation point. The logical _not_  changes  expression to the opposite meaning. For example, if you want to perform some actions only if the state is not New York, use this syntax:

`if (!state.equals("New York"))`

The following two expressions will produce the same result, because _more than 50_ and _not less or or equal to 50_ have the same meaning:

`if (price > 50)`

`if (!(price <=50))`

In the second example the _logical not_ is applied to the expression in parentheses.

==== Conditional operator

There is another flavor of an if statement called _conditional operator_, which allows to assign a value to a variable based on the expression that ends with a question mark. It's like you're asking, "Is this true?". If such an  expression is `true`, the value after the question mark is used, otherwise the value after the colon is assigned to the variable on the left:

`discount = price > 50? 10:5;`

If the price is greater than fifty, the variable `discount` will get the value of 10, otherwise the value of 5. It’s just a shorter replacement of the following if statement:

[source, java]
----
if (price > 50){
   discount = 10;
} else {
   discount = 5;
}
----

==== Using `else if`

You are also allowed to build more complex `if` statements with several `else if` blocks. To illustrate this technique let's create a new class called `ReportCard`. This class will have two methods: `main()` and  `convertGrades()` with one argument  - the school test result. Depending on the number, it should print your grade like A, B, C, or D. 

[source, java]
----
public class ReportCard {

  String studentName;

/**
 The method convertGrades has one integer argument - the result of the school test.  The method returns one letter A, B, C or D depending on the argument's value. 
*/
 public char convertGrades( int testResult){

	char grade;

	if (testResult >= 90){
		grade = 'A';
	} else if (testResult >= 80 && testResult < 90){
	      grade = 'B';
    }else if (testResult >= 70 && testResult < 80){
	    	grade = 'C';
	}else {
	    	grade = 'D';
	}
	
	return grade;
   
 }

 public static void main(String[] args){

	ReportCard rc = new ReportCard();
		
	char yourGrade = rc.convertGrades(88);
	System.out.println("Your first grade is " + 
                                          yourGrade);
		
	yourGrade = rc.convertGrades(79);
	System.out.println("Your second grade is " +  
                                          yourGrade);
 }			
}
----

Beside using the `else if` condition, this example also shows you how to use variables of type `char`. You can also see that with the `&&` operator you can check if a number falls into some range. You can not just write _if testResult between 80 and 89_,  but with _logical and_ you can check the condition when `testResult` is greater or equal to 80 and less then 89 at the same time: 

`testResult >= 80 && testResult < 89`

Take a guess, why we could not use the _logical or_ operator here? Say the `testResult` is 100. It's greater than 80, and the above expression would evaluate to true, because for  the || operator having one `true` is enough to make the entire expression true. But this is not what we want - we need the above expression to be true only if the value of `testResult` is between 80 and 89. The _logiacl and_ operator does the job by ensuring that both conditions are true. 

==== The `switch` Statement 

The `switch` statement sometimes can be used as an alternative to `if`. The variable after the keyword `switch`  is evaluated, and program goes only to one of the `case`  statements:

[source, java]
----
public static void main(String[] args){

 ReportCard rc = new ReportCard();
 rc.studentName = "Jerry Lee";

 char yourGrade = rc.convertGrades(88);

  switch (yourGrade){

   case 'A':
     System.out.println("Excellent Job!");
	   break;
   case 'B':
	   System.out.println("Good Job!");
	   break;
   case 'C':
	   System.out.println("Need to work more!");
 	   break;
   case 'D':
     System.out.println("Change your attitude!");
	 break;
 }
 // Some other program code goes here

}
----
Say, the value of `yourGrade` is `B`. Then the above code will print "Good Job!" and will break out of the `switch` statement to continue executing the rest of the program code if any.

Do not forget to put the keyword `break` at the end of each `case` statement to make the code jump out of the `switch`. For example, if you forget to put the `break` in the `case 'B'` block, the above code would print "Good Job!" followed by "You need to work more!".  

[[FIG4-2]]
.The switch statement

=== How Long Variables Live? 

Class `ReportCard` declares a variable `grade` inside the method `convertGrades()`. If you declare a variable inside any method, such variable is called  _local_. This means that this variable is available only for the code _within this method_. When the method completes, this variable automatically gets removed from memory.

Programmers use the word _scope_ to say how long a variable will live, for example you can say that variables declared inside a method have a local scope. If a variable is declared within the code block surrounded with curly braces (e.g. in the if statement), it has a block scope and won't be visible outside of this block.

If a variable has to be reused by several method calls, or it has to be visible from more than one method in a class, you should declare such a variable outside of any method. In the class `Fish` from Chapter 3, the `currentDepth` is a _member variable_. The member variable `currentDepth` is  alive until the instance of the object `Fish` exists in memory. You can call `currentDepth` _a instance variable_, because its declaration doesn't include the keyword `static`, which we'll discuss shortly. 

Member variables can be shared and reused by all methods of the class, and we can make them visible from external classes too, if need be. For example the method `main()` of the class `ReportCard` includes the statement `System.out.println()`. It uses the class variable `out` that was declared in the Java class `System`. 

==== The Keyword `static`

Wait a minute! Can we use a member variable `out` from the class `System` if we have not even created an instance of this class?  Yes we can, if the class `System` declares the variable `out` with a keyword `static`. 

When you start any Java program if _loads_ the definition of the required classes in memory. The definition of a class can be used for creating of one or mode instances of this class for example:

[source, java]
----
ReportCard rc = new ReportCard();
rc1.studentName = "Jerry Lee";

ReportCard rc2 = new ReportCard();
rc2.studentName = "Sarah Smith";
----

In this example we have two instances of the class `ReportCard`, and each of them has its own value in the variable `studentName`, which is an instance variable. Now, let's change the declaration of this variable by adding the  keyword `static`: 

`static String studentName;`

In this case both instances of the `ReportCard` would share the same variable `studentName`, and the above code would first assign "Jerry Lee" to this variable, and then it would be replaced with "Sarah Smith". This is not a good idea, is it? 

Moreover, if the declaration of a member variable or a method starts with `static`, you do not have to create an instance of this class to use such a variable or a method. Static members of a class are used to store the values that are the same for all instances of the class.

For example, the method `convertGrades()` should be declared as `static` in the class `ReportCard`, because its code does not use  member variables to store values specific to a particular instance of the class.

[source, code]
----
public static char convertGrades( int testResult){
   // the code of this method goes here
}    
----

There is no need to create instances to call static methods or access static variables. Just write the name of the class followed by the dot and the name of the static member: 

`char yourGrade = ReportCard.convertGrades(88);`

Here’s another example: Java has a class `Math` that contains several dozens of mathematical methods like `sqrt()`,  `sin()`, `abs()` and others. All these methods are `static` and you do not need to create an instance of the class `Math` to call them, for example:

`double squareRoot = Math.sqrt(4.0);`

=== Special Methods: Constructors

You've already learned that Java uses the operator `new` to create instances of  objects in memory, for example:

`Fish myFish = new Fish();`

Parentheses after the word `Fish` tell us that this class has some method called `Fish()`. Yes, there are special methods that are  called  _constructors_, and these methods have the following features:

*	Constructors are special methods that are called only once  during construction of the object in memory.
*	They must have the same name as the class itself.
*	They do not return a value, and you do not even have to  use  the keyword  `void` in the constructor’s declaration.

Any class can have more than one constructor. If you do not create a constructor for the class, Java automatically creates one during the compilation time - it's so-called _default no-argument constructor_.  That’s why Java compiler has never complained about the statements  `new Fish()` or `new ReportCard()`, even though neither class `Fish` nor class `ReportCard` has any explicitly declared constructor.

In general, constructors are used to assign initial values to  member variables of the class, for example the next version of class `Fish` has a one-argument constructor that  just assigns the argument’s value to the instance variable `currentDepth` for future  use.

[source, java]
----
public class Fish extends Pet {
    int currentDepth;

	// This is constructor
  Fish(int startingPosition){
		currentDepth=startingPosition;
	}
}
----

Now the class `FishMaster` can create an instance of the `Fish` and assign the initial position of the fish. The next example creates an instance of the `Fish` that is “submerged”  20 feet under the sea:

`Fish myFish = new Fish(20);`

If a constructor with arguments has been defined in a class, you can no longer use the default no-argument constructor. If you’d like to have a constructor without arguments - write one.

=== The Keyword `this`

The keyword `this` is useful when your code needs to refer to the  instance of the object, where this code is running.  Look at the next code example, which is a slight modification of the previous one: 

[source, java]
----
class Fish {
  int currentDepth ;  

  Fish(int currentDepth){
	this.currentDepth = currentDepth;
  }
}
----

Have you noticed that the member variable and the constructor's argument have the same name? The keyword `this` helps to avoid name conflicts. In this code sample `this.currentDepth` refers to the object's member variable `currentDepth`, while the `currentDepth` refers to the argument’s value. In other words, the code points at the current instance of the `Fish` object.	 

[[FIG4-3]]
.I'm this object
image::images/fig_4_03.png[]

You’ll see another important example of using the keyword `this` in Chapter 6 in the section _How to Pass Data Between  Classes_.

=== Arrays

An array is an object that holds several values of the same type - primitives or objects. Let’s say your program has to store the names of four game players. Instead of declaring four different `String` variables, you can declare one `String` _array_ that has four _elements_. Arrays are marked by placing square brackets either after the variable name, or after the data type:

`String [] players;`

or

`String players[];`

These declarations just tell the Java compiler that you are planning to store several text strings in the array `players`.  Each element has its own index (the position number) starting from zero. The next sample actually creates an instance of an array that can store four `String` elements and assigns the values to the elements of this array:

`players = new String [4];`

`players[0] = "David";`
`players[1] = "Daniel";`
`players[2] = "Anna";`
`players[3] = "Gregory";`

You must declare the size of the array before assigning values to its elements. If you do not know in advance how many elements you are going to have, you cannot use arrays, but should look into other classes - Java collections. For example the `ArrayList` object does not require you to announce the exact number of elements in advance. I'll show you some example of using the `ArrayList` collection in Chapter 10 about data collections.

Any array has an attribute called `length` that stores the  number of elements in this array, and you can always find out how many elements are there:

`int  totalPlayers = players.length;`

If you know all the values that will be stored in the array at the time when you declare it, Java allows you to declare and initialize such array in one shot:

`String [] players = {"David", "Daniel", "Anna", "Gregory"};`

[[FIG4-4]]
.The array of playes
image::images/fig_4_04.png[]

Imagine that the second player is a winner and you’d like to write the code to congratulate this kid. If the players’ names are stored in an array get its second element:

[source, Java]
----
String theWinner = players[1];
System.out.println("Congratulations, " + theWinner + "!");
----
The output from these two lines of code will look like this:

_Congratulations, Daniel!_

Do you know why the second element has the index [1]? Of course you do, because the index of the first element is always [0]. 

The array of players in our example is called _one-dimensional array_. Imagine the players sitting like ducks in a row. The single dimension is the seat number here. If the players (or game spectators) will occupy several rows, then we'll have two dimensions - the row number and a set number within the row. This is the case where we'd need to declare a two-dimensional array. Java allows creation of _multi-dimensional_ arrays, and I’ll show you how to do this in Chapter 10.

=== Repeating Actions with Loops

A loop is a language construct that allows to repeat the same action multiple times. For example, if we need to print congratulation to several winners, the printing code should be invokes several times _in a loop_. When you know in advance how many times this action has to be repeated, you can use a loop with a keyword `for`:

[source, java]
----
int  totalPlayers = players.length;
int counter;

for (counter=0; counter < totalPlayers; counter++){
 String thePlayer = players[counter];
 System.out.println("Congratulations,"+ 
                                    thePlayer+"!"); 
}
----

The above code means the following: 

_Print the value of the element from the `players` array  whose number is the same as the current value of the_ `counter`. _Start from the element number 0: _ `counter=0)`, _and  increment the value of the_ `counter`  _by one:_ `(counter++)`. _Keep doing this  while the_ `counter` _is less than_  `totalPlayers`_:_ `counter<totalPlayers`. 

JVM executes every line between the curly braces and then returns back to the first line of the loop to increment the counter and check the conditional expression.

There is another flavor of the `for` loop that's called _for each loop_. It allows to repeat the same action to every element of the collection without even knowing how many are there. You are basically saying, do this for each element.The for-each loop allows to congratulate players in a more concise manner:

[source, java]
----
for (String pl: players){
 System.out.println("Congratulations," + pl +"!"); 
} 
----

You can read the above code as follows:

_The variable_ `pl` _has the same type as the array's elements:_ `String` _. Use this variable as a cursor, point it to each element in the array_ `players` _one by one and repeatedly execute the code inside the curly brackets for the current element._ 

There is another keyword for writing loops - `while`. In these loops you do not have to declare exactly how many times to repeat the action, but you still need to know when to end the loop.  Let’s see how we can congratulate players using the `while` loop that will end when the value of the variable `counter` becomes equal to the value of  `totalPlayers`:
 
[source, java]
----
int  totalPlayers = players.length;
int counter=0;

while (counter< totalPlayers){
  String thePlayer = players[counter];
  System.out.println("Congratulations, "
                                + thePlayer + "!");  
  counter++; 
}
----

In Chapter 9 you’ll learn how to save the data on the disk and how to read the saved data back into computer’s memory. If you read game scores from the disk file, you do not know in advance how many scores were saved there. Most likely you’ll be reading the scores using the `while` or for-each loop, which don't require you to state the number of iterations upfront. 
 
You can also use two important keywords with loops: `break` and `continue`.

As with `switch` statements, the keyword `break` is used to jump out of the loop when some particular condition is `true`. Let’s say we do not want to print more than 3 congratulations, regardless of how many players we’ve got. In the next example, after printing the array elements 0, 1 and 2, the `break` will make the code go out of the loop and the program will continue from the line after the closing curly brace. 

The next code sample has the double equal sign `==` in the `if` statement. This means that you are comparing the value of the variable `counter` with number 3.  A single equal sign in the here would mean assignment of the value of 3 to the variable `counter`.  Placing `=` in an `if` statement instead of `==` is a very tricky mistake, and it can lead to unpredictable program errors that may not be so easy to find.

[source, java]
----
int counter =0;
while (counter< totalPlayers){

  if (counter == 3){
   break; // Jump out of the loop
  }
  String thePlayer = players[counter];
  System.out.println("Congratulations, "+thePlayer+ "!");
  counter++; 
}
----

The keyword `continue` allows the code to skip some code lines and return back to the beginning of the loop.  Imagine that you want to congratulate everyone but David – the keyword `continue` will return the program back to the beginning of the loop:

[source, java]
----
while (counter< totalPlayers){
  counter++; 

  String thePlayer = players[counter];

  if (thePlayer.equals("David"){
      continue;
  }
  System.out.println("Congratulations, "+ thePlayer+ !");  
}
----

There is yet another flavor of the `while` loop that starts with the word `do`, for example:

[source, java]
----
do {
   System.out.println("Congratulations, "+
                         players[counter] + !");
   counter++;

 } while (counter< totalPlayers);
----

Such loops check an expression _after_ executing the code between curly braces, which means that code in the loop will  be executed _at least once_.  Loops that start with the keyword `while` might not be executed at all if the loop expression is false to begin with.


=== Challenge Yourself

1. Create a new IntelliJ Idea Java project as described in Chapter 2. Name it Chapter4.

2. In the src directory of the project create a new class (the menu File | New) named _TemperatureConverter_. 

3. Add the method `convertTemp()` so the code of the class looks like this:
+
[source, java]
----
public class TemperatureConverter {
    public static float convertTemp (float temperature, 
                               char convertTo) {

    }
}
----

4. Write the if statement inside the method `convertTemp()` to check the value of the argument `convertTo`. If it's `F`, the temperature has to be converted to Fahrenheit, and if it’s `C`, convert it to Celsius. Return the result. The method convertTemp() should look like this:
+
[source, java]
----
    public static String convertTemp (float temperature, char convertTo) {

        if (convertTo=='F'){
             return "The temperature in Fahrenheit is " + (9*temperature/5 + 32);
         } else if(convertTo=='C') {
            return "The temperature in Celsius is " + (temperature - 32)*5/9;
        }  else{
            return "You can enter either F or C as convertTo argument";
        }
    }
----

5. Add a method main() using the shortcut psvm + Tab as explained in Chapter 2. It should look like this:
+
[source, java]
----
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Converting 21C to Fahrenheit. " +  convertTemp(21,'F'));
        System.out.println("Converting 70F to Celsius. " +  convertTemp(70,'C'));

6. Run the program `TemperatureConverter` using the IDEA menu Run | Run TemperatureConverter. If you did everything right, you should see the following output on the IDEA console:

Converting 70F to Celsius. The temperature in Celsius is 21.11111_
