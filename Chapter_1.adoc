== Chapter 1. Writing Your First Program

People talk to each other using different languages. Programmers write computer programs like games, calculators, text editors using different programming languages too. Without programs,the screen of your computer, smartphone or a game console would always be black. All these devices are often called _hardware_, and programs are known as _software_. For many many years Java remains one of the most popular computer languages. Just check out this http://www.tiobe.com/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html[popularity index] by Tiobe. I'm not sure when are you looking at this chart, but I can bet that Java is among the top three languages there. What makes the Java language so hot?

First of all, the same Java program can _run_ (work) on different devices like PC, MacBook, or larger computers. As a matter of fact, Java programs do not even know where they run, because they run inside of a special software shell known as Java Virtual Machine (JVM). If, for example, your Java program needs to print some messages, it asks JVM to do this, and JVM knows how to deal with your printer.

Second, you can write programs in Java for various mobile devices.

Third, Java can be embedded in tiny microchips that control various home appliances or industrial devices. You probably heard about smart homes where the heater or light can be programmed remotely from your phone. The time will come soon when a teapot will automatically start boiling at the time set in your phone's alarm. There is even a term for this - Internet of Things, and these things can be programmed in Java. 

Forth, learning Java is not difficult, because it is _object-oriented_ language. Java's program elements (_classes_) represent objects from the real world. For example, you can create a class called `Car` and give it attributes  like doors, wheels, similarly to what the real cars have. After that, based on the `Car` class you can create another class, for example `Tesla`, which will have all the features of the class `Car` (doors, wheels, body) plus something that only Teslas have (electric engine).   

Fifth, if a Java program that runs on remote servers need to process requests of thousands users, such a program can run use multiple parallel processors or even servers. For example, http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelkanellos/2013/03/21/ebays-mpg-for-data-centers/[eBay runs thousands of servers] in parallel (a.k.a. _concurrently_), and many of them run Java applications.
    
Sixth, from day one the software required to write Java programs was free. There are more than nine million professional Java programmers in the world, and they publish on the Internet lots and lots of program samples so if you're run into a problem, you can either find the solution by searching online or ask your question in one of the popular online forums like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/java[Stack Overflow], and someone will answer your question! 

This list can go on and on. Besides, if you are planning to work as a computer programmer, Java skills in the industry are in high demand. Enough talking, let's install some software to start learning Java.  

=== Installing Java on Your Computer

To start programming in Java you need to download Java Development Kit (JDK) from the company called Oracle, which leads most of the Java-related work and makes releases and updates of Java versions. The full name of the software to download is Java SE Development Kit. We'll download the  Java SE 8, which is the latest version at the time of this writing. Just visit this   
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Oracle's Web site]. Accept the license agreement and select the proper link depending on the Operational System (OS) installed on your computer. 

NOTE: While Java programmers need JDK installed, the users of your applications need to have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their machines. JRE is included in JDK, but can be downloaded separately too.

[[FIG1-1]]

If you use Windows OS, download the file named jdk-8-windows-i586.exe. Since I work with Apple computers with Mac OS X, the file'jdk-8-macosx-x64.dmg' is my Java installer. Run your installer program, agree with all default answers (just press the button Next) and you're almost ready to go.
 
In Mac OS Java is installed in the folder _/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0.jdk_. On Windows computers it'll be installed under  
_c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_, where _c:_ is the name of your hard drive or SSD. If you use Mac OS, your installation is complete. 

==== For Windows Users Only

If you use Windows, you'll also need to add Java to the environment  variable `Path`. Click on the menu Start, Control Panel, System and search for _Environment Variables_. You'll see all system variables that exist in your OS As shown on the screenshot <<FIG1-4>>. If you have administrator's rights on your Windows PC, you can set user variables that will apply only when a certain user logs into your PC, or system variables that will apply to all users.


[[FIG1-4]]
.Windows OS - System Variables

Press the lower button _Edit_ - you need to add the _bin_ directory from your JDK at the beginning of the `Path` variable value. For example, add  _c:\Program Files\java\jdk1.8.0\bin;_ if this is where your JDK is installed:

Now the Windows installation of JDK is complete! I'm sure you're eager to start writing your first program now. Let's do it. 

=== Three Main Steps in Java Programming
 
If you have an idea _what_ to program, typically you'll need to perform the following three steps: 

. _Write_ the program in Java programming language and save it in a file.

. _Compile_ the program to translate it from Java language into a special _byte code_ that JVM understands.

. _Run_ the program.

==== Command Window

In this chapter we'll compile and run Hello World program in the Command window if you use Microsoft Windows or from Terminal application if you're on Mac OS.

In Windows to open the Command window click on the _Start_ menu and enter the letters _cmd_ in the field that read _Search programs and files_ . On Mac, open the Spotlight window by clicking on the looking glass icon at the top right corner of the screen, type the word Terminal and hit the button Return on the keyboard. 

First, create a folder name _practice_ by entering the following command:

_mkdir practice_

This will be the place, where we'll store all our Java programs. 

==== Step 1 – Write the Program

Starting from Chapter 2 will use a special application  called Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write, compile, and run programs. But to get a better understanding of how things work, let's use any plain text editor (e.g. Notepad, TextEdit et al.) to type in the code of our first Java program. Then you need to save the code in a text file with a name ending in _.java_. 

[[FIG1-8]]
.Typing the code 
image::images/fig_1_08.png[]

For example, if you want to write a program called `HelloWorld`, enter its code in a text editor. 
Here is the program that prints the words _Hello World!_ on your computer's screen:

[source, java] 
----
public class HelloWorld{

    public static void main(String[] args){

       System.out.println("Hello World!");
    
    }
}
----

Save the above code in this folder in the file named `HelloWorld.java` in folder _practice_. Keep in mind that you are not allowed to use blanks in Java file names. 

I’ll explain how this program works a little later in this chapter. For now just trust me – this program will print the words _Hello World_ on the screen in the step 3, which will happen pretty soon.

Programmers often use the words _the source code_ to refer to a program. So it's safe to say the we wrote the source code of the program Hello World. Unless you're experienced Java programmer, you can's just say if this program is written correctly. Let's proceed to Step 2 to find out.

==== Step 2 – Compile the Program

Now you need to start Java compiler asking to turn the source code of Hello World program into byte code that JRE  understands. The program named _javac_ is Java compiler, which is installed on your computer as a part of the JDK and is located in the _bin_ folder in your JDK.

[[FIG1-10]]
.Compiling the source code 
image::images/fig_1_10.png[width=400, height=550]


Change the directory to _practice_ with the command _cd practice_. If you never used the command _cd_ before, read  the online instructions on how to do it on http://www.wikihow.com/Change-Directories-in-Command-Prompt[Windows] or on http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line[Mac OS]. Now compile the program using the following command:

_javac HelloWorld.java_

You won’t see any confirmation message that your program `HelloWorld` has been compiled successfully. Having no messages means there is no problems. Type a command _dir_ on Windows or _ls_ on Mac and you'll see the list of files in folder _practice_. This is how it looks in my Terminal window:

[[FIG1-11]]
.HelloWorld compiled successfully
image::images/fig_1_11.png[]

First, I've entered the _pwd_ command to make sure I'm in the _practice_ folder. You should see there a new file named `HelloWorld.class`. This proves that your program has been successfully compiled. Your original file `HelloWorld.java` is also there, and you can modify this file later to print _Hello Mom_ or something else.

If the program has syntax errors, let’s say you forgot to type the last curly brace, Java compiler will print an error message. Now you’d need to fix the error, and recompile the program again. If you have several errors, you may need to repeat these actions more than once until the file `HelloWorld.class` is created.


==== Step 3 – Run the Program

Now let’s run the program. In the same Command or Terminal window enter the following:

_java HelloWorld_

After running this command, you'll see the text _Hello World!_ printed in the Terminal window as shown on <<FIG1-12>>. Have you noticed that this time you’ve used the program _java_ and not _javac_?  This is how you start JRE providing it the name of the application to run (HelloWorld in this case).

[[FIG1-12]]
.Running HelloWorld
image::images/fig_1_12.png[]

Keep in mind that Java does not treat capital and small letters the same, which means that if you named the program `HelloWorld` with a capital `H` and a capital `W`, do not try to start the program `helloworld` or `helloWorld` – the JRE will complain. The file name should match the class name too. Typically, each file of your application contains the code of one class even though you can keep the code of more than one class in the same file.  

Now let’s have some fun - try to guess how to modify the code of the program that prints Hello World.  I’ll explain how this program works in the next chapter, but still, try to guess what has to be done to say hello to your pet, friend or print your address. Go through all three steps to see if the program still works after your changes. If you don't have a pet, you can always say hello to my puppy - his name is Sammy. Are you up for the challenge to write a program that prints Hello Sammy! on the screen?

In the next chapter you'll learn how to write, compile and run your programs in a more convenient environment than just a text editor and a Command window.
