== Chapter 6. Access Levels, Collections, and Generics 

I'll start this chapter with the explanation of how to hide and protect data using so called access level qualifiers. After that we'll experiment with Java collections - the language elements that can store multiple objects of the same type. Remember arrays and their limitations? Java collections offer alternative ways of storing similar objects. Finally, you'll get familiar with the mechanism of _generics_ that allows Java compiler to ensure that you won't be using the wrong data types with data collections or other objects.

=== Access Levels 

In code samples from previous chapters I've been using the keyword `public` in declaration of member variables and methods. This means that such a variable or a method can be accesses by any other code from the project. You can declare a class, a method, or a member variable to be `public`, `private`, or `protected`. If one of these keywords is missing, Java compiler assumes that it's a _package access level_ - this element can be access only from the code located in the same package ( directory).

One of the main features of object-oriented languages is _encapsulation_ - an ability to hide and protect data or code. But who do you need to hide or protect the code from? This is not a protection from bad guys who are not allowed to see your code. You hide and protect the code from misuse.

Let's consider an example from the real world. Think of a car – most people have no clue how many parts are there under the hood, and what actually happens when a driver pushes the brake pedal. If car designers would not be hiding control of some of the under-the-hood operations, the driver would have to deal with hundreds of buttons, switches and gauges on the car's dashboard.

When you design a  class, hide methods and class member variables that should not be visible from outside. Some of the methods of member variables are meant to be used internally and not to be exposed to other classes.

We'll start learning about hiding and protecting data with the `private` access level. If a variable or a method are declared private, they can be used only within the class where they were declared. The next code sample represents the class `Car` and declares some of its members as `private`. Note that I've created this class in the package `vehicles`.

[source, java]
----
package vehicles;

public class Car {
  
 // This private variable is visible only inside this class
  private String brakesCondition;

 // The public method brake() calls private methods
 // to decide which brakes to use
  public void brake(int pedalPressure){
    boolean useRegularBrakes; 
    useRegularBrakes=
              checkForAntiLockBrakes (pedalPressure);
        
    if (useRegularBrakes==true){
    useRegularBrakes(); 
    }else{
    useAntiLockBrakes();
    }
  }

  // This private method can be called inside 
  // this class only
  private boolean checkForAntiLockBrakes(int pressure){
    if (pressure > 100){
      return true;
    }else {
      return false;
    }
  }

   // This private method can be called inside this   
   // class only
  private void useRegularBrakes(){
   // code that sends a signal to regular brakes
  }

   // This private method can be called inside this 
   // class only
  private void useAntiLockBrakes(){
   // code that sends a signal to anti-lock brakes
   // 
  }
}
----
By looking at this code I can say that the class `Car` exposes only one public method `brake()`, which internally may invoke several other functions that a driver does not need to know about. For example, if the driver pushes the brakes pedal too hard, the car’s computer may apply special anti-lock brakes implemented in private methods. 

I took the next screen shot in IntelliJ IDEA while writing a class `CarMaster` that uses `Car`. IDEA helps me with suggesting the `Car` class members that I can use in this context. Only the method `brake()` is visible from the class `Car` (other methods are from the class `Object`).

[[FIG6-2]]

The `private` access level is the most restrictive one. If you're not sure when to use it, just declare all of your call member variables and methods as private, and loosen this restriction if other classes need to use these members.

[[FIG6-3]]

What do you think will happen if you simply remove the `private` keyword from one of the methods of the class `Car`? Will the `CarMaster` see it? No, it won't because the absence of the access qualifier gives a package access level to this member. Only classes that are located in the package `vehicles` can access it, and `CarMaster` is not one of them.

The class members declared with the `protected` keyword can be accessed from other members of the same class, from its descendants or classes located in the same package. Even if a descendant class is located in a different package, it'll be able to access `protected` methods of its ancestors. 

Some software developer are creating libraries or frameworks of classes to be used by other developers. These classes can be extended, and their creators may use the keyword `protected` trying to allow access to certain member only descendant classes. But in the real world no one can predict what the developer may want to do with there libraries, and the keyword `protected` may become an obstacle in achieving of their goals. I do not use the keyword `protected` in my projects. As you gain more experience with Java, see for yourself if the keyword `protected` brings some value to your programs. 

=== Casting

In Java all classes are directly or indirectly inherited from the class `Object`, which is the root of the class hierarchy. In Figure 2 you've seen a class `Car` that has number of methods that we've never declared - they belong to the class `Object`, and the class `Car` extends `Object` even though we've never asked for it.  So any of your application classes has an ancestor - `Object`.

When you declare a variable to represent an instance of your class, you can give it a type either of your class or any of its ancestors. For example, both of the following declarations are correct:

[source, java]
----
Car myCar = new Car();

Object myOtherCar = new Car();
----

Java compiler can _cast_ (convert) one data type to another as long they have inheritance relation. In particular, Java compiler can automatically cast the type to the class ancestors. This is called _upcasting_. But if a variable has the type of a super class, it won't see any members of teh subclass. The next screen shot shows that the variable `myOtherCar` doesn't see the method `brake()` declared in the class `Car`.


[[FIG6-4]]
.The Object type variable doesn't see Car's members
image::images/fig_6_04.png[]

But you can say, "Doesn't the variable `myOtherCar` point at the instance of the class `Car`, which has a public method `brake()`?" That's right, but since I declared this variable of the type `Object` the variable `myOtherCar` assumes that its just a general object.  The programmer can _downcast_ the general type to a more specific one, but this has to be done explicitly by placing the specific type of the object in parentheses before the variable of more general type, for example: 

[source, java]
----
Object myOtherCar = new Car();

Car myOtherCarAfterCasting = (Car) myOtherCar;
----

It's like you're saying, "I know that the variable `myOtherCar` is of type ``Object`, but it actually points at the `Car` instance". Now the variable `myOtherCarAfterCasting` will see the method `brake()` declared in the class `Car`:

[[FIG6-5]]
.The Car type variable sees Car's members
image::images/fig_6_05.png[]

Why do we need all these complications? Can't we just always declare variables of the specific types? Sometimes we can't. For example, JDK comes with lots of other classes that were written to work with the `Object` data types. Data collection classes were written to be able to store instances of any objects. 

Creators of data collections had no idea that you might need to store instances of `Car` or `Fish` there. But when you use the data collection object in your program, the data type is known. In the next section you'll see an example of a `FishTank` program that stores instances of the class `Fish` in the `ArrayList` and then casts them back to the type `Fish`:

[source, java]
----
theFish = (Fish) fishTank.get(i);
----  

=== Data Collections

Now let's see how to work with collections of data. Java  packages `java.util` and `java.util.concurrent` include  classes that are quite handy when a program needs to store several instances of some objects in  memory. There are dozens of collection classes in Java, but I'll just show you a couple of them. Some of the popular collection from the  package `java.util` are `ArrayList`,  `HashTable`, `HashMap`, and `List`. 

The package `java.util.concurrent` has collections useful in programs that require concurrent (simultaneous) access to some data by different parts of a program (by multiple _threads_). I'll introduce you briefly to concurrent programming in Chapter 13, but the materials about concurrent collections don't belong to the introductory book like this one.

==== The Class ArrayList

In Chapter 4 you've got familiar with Java arrays, which have a limitation - you have to specify the number of array elements during the declaration of array. But often you don't know in advance how many elements are there. For example, if you want to write a program that would print all your followers in Twitter, their number may change many times a day. The class `java.util.ArrayList` can give you more flexibility - it can grow or shrink in size as needed.

Why use arrays, then?  Let’s just always use `ArrayList`! Unfortunately, nothing  comes for free, and you have to pay the price for having a convenience of dynamically sized arrays. The `ArrayList` works is a little slower than a regular array. Besides, you can only store objects there, while arrays allows you to store primitives too.   

To create and populate an `ArrayList` you should instantiate it first and then create instances of the objects you are planning to store there. Add each object to the `ArrayList` by calling its method `add()`. The next little program will populate an `ArrayList`  with `String` objects and then print each element of this collection.

[source, java]
----
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ArrayListDemo {
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create and populate an ArrayList
    ArrayList friends = new ArrayList();
    friends.add("Mary");
    friends.add("Ann");
    friends.add("David");
    friends.add("Roy");
    
    // How many friends are there?
    int friendsCount = friends.size();  
     
    // Print the content of the ArrayList
    for (int i=0; i<friendsCount; i++){
        System.out.println("Friend #" + i + " is " 
            + friends.get(i));
    }
  }
}
----

This program will print the following:

[source, java]
----
Friend #0 is Mary
Friend #1 is Ann
Friend #2 is David
Friend #3 is Roy
----

The method `get()` extracts the element located at the specified position in the `ArrayList`. Since you can store any objects in this collection, the method `get()` returns each element of the `Object` type. The program to _cast_ this object to a proper data type. We did not have to do it in the previous example only because we stored `String` objects in the collection `friends`, and Java knows how to convert an `Object` to a `String` automatically. 

Let's see how you can work with some other objects in `ArrayList`, for example instances of the class `Fish` shown next. 

[source, java]
----
package pets;

public class Fish {
      private float weight;
      private String color;

    // constructor

    Fish(float weight, String color){
        this.setWeight(weight);
        this.setColor(color);
    }

    // getters and setters

    public float getWeight() {
        return weight;
    }

    public void setWeight(float weight) {
        this.weight = weight;
    }

    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    public void setColor(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }
}
----

Note that the class fields `color` and `weight` are `private` variables. But this class also defines `public` _getters and setters_ - the methods that read or modify the fields. In this example the setters and getters don't contain any application logic, but they could. For example, you could encapsulate the logic that checks the credentials of the users of this class so not everyone can modify the weight property. By Java naming conventions the setter name starts with the prefix `set` followed by the capitalized letter of the corresponding `private` variable. Accordingly, the getter starts with `get`.

NOTE: IntelliJ IDEA can automatically generate setters and getters for the class. Just right-click on the class name and select the options Refactor | Encapsulate Fields. 

The code to add (and extract) a particular `Fish` to the `ArrayList` collection may look as in the program `FishTank` that comes next. 

[source, java]
----
package pets;

import java.util.ArrayList;

public class FishTank {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
     ArrayList fishTank = new ArrayList();

     Fish fish1 = new Fish(2.5f, "Red");
     Fish fish2 = new Fish(5, "Green");

     Fish theFish;

     fishTank.add(fish1);
     fishTank.add(fish2);

     int fishCount = fishTank.size();

     for (int i=0;i<fishCount; i++){

         theFish = (Fish) fishTank.get(i);  // casting
         System.out.println("Got the " +
            theFish.getColor() + " fish that weighs " +
            theFish.getWeight() + " pounds.");
     }
 }
}
----

First, this program creates a couple of instances of the class `Fish` passing the values for the fields via constructor. Note the letter _f_ in the weight value of the first fish: `2.5f`. In Java all decimal literals have the type `double` unless you mark it with the suffix _f_ for `float`. 

Each instance is added to the collection `fishTank`. Then, the program gets the objects from this collection, casts them to the class `Fish` and prints their values using getters. Here’s the output of the program `FishTank`:

[source, java]
----
Got the Red fish that weighs 2.5 pounds.
Got the Green fish that weighs 5.0 pounds.
----

The `ArrayList` collection uses Java arrays internally and initially creates an array for 10 elements. But if you keep adding more elements to `ArrayList` it internally will create another array of the larger size and copy all existing elements there. Because of this additional memory allocations and data copying `ArrayList` collections works a little slower than arrays, which allocate enough memory in advance.

==== The Class Hashtable

While the `ArrayList` collection only allows referencing its elements by index (e.g. `fishTank.get(i)`), sometimes it would be easier to reference collection elements by names as _key/value_ pairs. I'll illustrate by storing my friends' contact information in a `HashTable` collection that allows accessing objects by key names. Let's declare a simple class `ContactDetail`, which can store contact details of one person.

[source, java]
----
public class ContactDetail {
    String fullName;
    String facebookID;
    String phone;
    String email;
}
----

The program `HashTableDemo` will create and populate two instances of `ContactDetail`, will add them to the `Hashtable` collection by names (the keys), and then will print the phone number of the second contact.

[source, java]
----
import java.util.Hashtable;

public class HashTableDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        ContactDetail friend1 = new ContactDetail();
        friend1.fullName = "Jackie Allen";
        friend1.email = "jallen@gmail.com";
        friend1.facebookID = "jallen";
        friend1.phone="212-545-5545";

        ContactDetail friend2 = new ContactDetail();
        friend2.fullName = "Art Jones";
        friend2.email = "ajones@gmail.com";
        friend2.facebookID = "ajones";
        friend2.phone="212-333-2121";

        Hashtable friends = new Hashtable();
        friends.put("Jackie", friend1);
        friends.put("Art", friend2);

        // Cast from Object to ContactDetail
        String artsPhone = ((ContactDetail) friends.get("Art")).phone;

        System.out.println("Art's phone number is " + artsPhone);
    }
}
----

In this example I used the first name as the key in the method `put()` that adds elements to a `Hashtable`.  Hence one contact can be referred by the key `get("Jackie")`, and the other one as `get("Art")`. The method `get()` returns the collection element as the `Object` type, so I had to cast it to `ContactDetail` to be able to see the field `phone`.

`HashTable` requires each key to be unique. Say you have another contact named `Art` and will create a new instance of the `ContactDetail` object. If you'll add it to the same collection under the same key - `friends.put("Art", friend3);`  it'll replace the contact details of the first Art with the data of the second one. This happens because Java `Hashtable` internally generates a hash key (the number) from your key and uses it as an index to find the element when need be.The same names will generate the same hash keys.  So either give the second Art a nick like `ArtFromNYC` or use another Java collection like `ArrayList` to store your contacts. By the way, `ArrayList` even allows you to store duplicates (objects with the same values), while `Hashtable` doesn't. 

I'm not going to cover other Java collections here, but if you'd like to do your own research, read about such collections from the `java.util` package as `HashMap`, `HashSet`, and `LinkedList`. There is also a class `Collections` that has a bunch of useful static methods to operate on your data collections (e.g. `sort()`, `copy()`, `binarySearch()` et al.).
